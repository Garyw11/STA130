    "### COURSE PROJET PROPOSAL\n",
    "#### ANALYSIS 1: How does the frequency of meaningful social interactions interactions relate to life satisfaction in the population, and to what extent do individuals with more frequent social interactions report higher life satisfaction?\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "- The variables I would explore are named \"WELLNESS_life_satisfaction\" and \"CONNETION_meaningful_interaction\". This is because life satisfaction is a key indicator of personal well being. while the frequency of meaningful social interactions captures the extent of social connectedness. Studying the two variables can show some sort of relationship towards the importance of social interactions on mental and emotional health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scatter Plot: CONNECTION_meaningful_interactions (x-axis) and WELLNESS_life_satisfaction (y-axis)\n",
    "- This allows us to visualize any trends or relationships between the two variables, such as wether more interactions tend to align with higher life satisfaction (useful for SLR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression Analysis: we can perform a simple linear regression analysis -> under assumption of null hypothesis (there is no relationship), estimate beta1 slopes using least squares, define residuals, determine p-value, and intepret results. Life satisfaction would be the dependent variable and meaningful interactions would be the independent variable. \n",
    "- Hypothesis and expected outcome: Individuals who report a higher number of meaningful social interactions will also report a higher life satisfaction. The outcome we'd expect is a positive correlation between the two variables. If such is the case, this would mean that more meaningful social interactions would, indeed, improve mental and emotional health well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The results would underscore the critical role of social connections for well-being, supporting the project's goal of raising awareness about the importance of social health and could encourage the community to engage in more meaningful opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANALYSIS 2: Does self-rated mental health vary amongst different relationship statuses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The varibles I chose to examine in this case are named \"DEMO_relationship_status\" and \"WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health\"\n",
    "- Relationships could have a significant influence on mental health. I plan on creating groups with certain n individuals, and examine the two, for which I can uncover insights about the emotial benefits or challenges associated with each status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bar Chart: It is simple and clean visualization that clearly illustrates how mental health varies across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing missing values, then create booststrapped samples, then calculate the proportions for each relationship status in the booststrapped samples; then\n",
    "- Calculate confidence intervals for each proportion, which helps assess the uncertainty associated with the proportion estimates, eg. we can determine with 95% confidence that the true proportion of individuals who rated their mental health as \"very good\" in the population of \"single and dating\" lies between percent1 and percent2\n",
    "- Hypothesis and Expected Outcome: individuals who are in a relationship would report better self-rated mental health compared to those who are single and not dating, while those who are single and dating may fall in between\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance of results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Under our hypothesis, the results could enrouage individuals to foster supportive relationships for better mental health outcomes. Being in a relationship as well helps in reducing stress and opens up the opportunity to talk to someone close about anything on their mind and provide more socialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANALYSIS 3: Is there any significant relationship between age group and loneliness expressed on a loneliness scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I would like to explore the variables named \"DEMO_age\" and \"LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated\"\n",
    "- Age group would be the indepedent variable and loneliness would be the dependent variable. I plan on determining the distribution of isolation across the different age groups and observe any trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bar chart: we can easily see the distribution of different loneliness levels throughout the given age groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove missing values, then for each age group, randomly sample from the data with replacement to create multiple booststrapped samples\n",
    "- Calculate the proportion of respondents in each loneliness category for each booststrapped sample\n",
    "- Calculate the 95% confidence interval for each loneliness category\n",
    "- Results can be intepretted based off of the visuals and we can determine how reliable these estimates are based off of the confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis and Relevance of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I hypothesis that an older age group would experience stronger levels of loneliness due to the natural deteriation of health and sanity. It is also possible that by a certain age, a lot of the previous friends of the individual would perish and the incentive to make new friends would be rather low (less socialization).\n",
    "- The results could provide insights on the most vulnerable groups and therefore help tailor interventions and support systems towards that specific age group"
